        <p id="p4-font">
            The term "web design" describes the layout of websites that are seen online. Instead of software development, it typically refers to the user experience components of website development. <br> <br> The primary focus of web design used to be creating websites for desktop browsers, but from the middle of the 2010s, designing for mobile and tablet browsers has gained significance.

A notebook is one of the most basic and affordable tools used by designers. <br> <br> Before using a computer to complete the process, graphic artists frequently sketch out concepts or do preliminary drafts on paper.
